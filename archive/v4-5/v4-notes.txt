Notes for v4:

Started by separating KeyIndustry into a separate function with its own arcGIS rest query
so that the filter is applied straight into the arcGIS query, similar to FDI and Totals
(Did the same for Clusters) (Previous versions applied filters to datasource)

Removed Arizona from DropDown when Overview tab is selected, but show for FDI DropDown list

Selection in Grid matches chart

Updated colors and styling 

restricted filter to one category at a time using toggleClick; clear filter to reset and select a different category for filter

--

added totals, key industry chart, and clusters chart to FDI tab with filters; each as separate function
added "filtertype" to reset buttons

--

index-v3.html and EmpDashboard-v3.js:
changed top 20 share pie chart to text
added Open Sans google link
changed "sans serif" to "sans-serif" for .js file
flexbox vertical align
added <hr> below total business/job section on overview tab

--
v4 index and js:
hid tables on overview tab (Cluster and KI), added labels
export to excel
changed top20grid filter to arcgis query instead of changing datasource
overviewfilterapplied and top20overviewfilterapplied
excelExport function in grid

----
AB FEEDBACK: 
  *Not working on IE!!!  :(  //works on Edge though

  Total number of countries; only show top 20 (DONE)
  what about a map? (dynamic, change by geography) >> phase 2?

  *Add Explanations: -- language from Christian
    Up top: from MAG employer database, employees 4+
    what is cluster, key industry
    FDI : why is tracking important
--
v4(continued, 9/5):
autowidth columns and number formatting for excelExport

dynamic chart title for FDI Countries if < 20 countries

top20grid section combined with calculateTotals() section

dynamic title and grid height for top20grid (scroll for wrapped 2-line empname)

>>what to do about "top20share" when <20 employers? hide?
>>dynamic chart height based on number of categories?
>>check/standardize excel export file names

For IE:
<script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es5%2Cfetch%2CPromise"></script>

Excel Export doesn't work for IE and Safari - will need to use proxyURL or hide function 
The developer is responsible for implementing the server-side proxy. (path to proxy)

hid icon for IE

Before publishing:
- what icon to use for Total Businesses? (match overview and FDI tabs)
- How should we distinguish between Health Care Key Industry and Cluster?
- General nomenclature/standardization
- (For top 20 share of jobs, should the "total jobs" be filtered as well?)

For future development?
- Locations
- Key Industry % share of total jobs
- FDI map of all countries? dynamically change
- FDI tab double filter Country + Cluster/KI
- show message when chart has no data?
