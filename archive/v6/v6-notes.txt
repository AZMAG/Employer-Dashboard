v6 notes:

added csv export for all FDI tabs
added Locations to GroupedByFields functions
added toLowerCase() to GroupedByField function (didn't add to GroupedByTotals function - not needed, only used for employees)
added if statement for toLowerCase IF it is a string (for KI chart, numbers not string)

>> excel export for non-chrome browsers - proxyURL?

>>Arizona FDI Parent Countries Total Businesses/Jobs count not matching SQL...
(MSA, Maricopa, Pinal match ok)

Styled FDI table 
>> does not filter by geography; MSA only right now

Re-did tab dynamic dropdown list based on selected tab (used to use index which doesn't actually work - switched to get text of selected tab)

>>comparison with emp viewer reports
clarification that dashboard groups by empname? (viewer - largest location)
