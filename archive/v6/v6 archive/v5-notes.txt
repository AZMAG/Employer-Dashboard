v5 NOTES

re-formatted top20sharesection - cleaner
rounding sum in groupedbyfields function (no rounding for groupedbyfieldsTotal function) - excel exports rounded
added loading spinners on charts and grids
	>> add to "Totals" sections at top of each tab?
	- spinners load longer on grids even though data is already loaded...
